## üå± About the Project

This project was created as a scalable and customizable base for an e-commerce site. It features a mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS and emphasizes smooth UI experiences using React and Next.js for frontend rendering. On the backend, Express.js and Firebase Realtime Database handle product management and data persistence.

The goal was to create a simple yet robust full-stack application that covers the essential features of any e-commerce site: listing items, filtering by category, user roles, and a streamlined administrative experience.

## Image Uploads with Firebase Storage

Images uploaded through the app are stored securely in Firebase Storage. After a successful upload, the app saves the image‚Äôs accessible URL in the Firebase Realtime Database (or Firestore), allowing easy retrieval and display of images throughout the application without storing the actual image files in the database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design & Architecture Decisions

- **Next.js** was chosen for its hybrid rendering (static and server-side), which enables blazing-fast performance and SEO optimization out of the box.
- **React** powers the UI components, making the interface modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.
- **Tailwind CSS** was used for styling because of its utility-first approach, allowing fast prototyping with a clean, consistent design system.
- **Express.js** handles our custom API routes and integrates cleanly with Firebase functions for secure, server-side logic.
- **Firebase Realtime Database** provides a lightweight, fast, and scalable backend for handling dynamic data such as product listings, user accounts, and admin actions.
